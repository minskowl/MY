	/// Provides an all managed implementation of Native Microsoft Windows 
	/// IOCP feature. This class does not provide IOCP based on I/O handles.
	/// Rather it provides waitable object queuing features of Native IOCP using 
	/// all managed .Net threading and synchronization primitives. 
	/// 
	/// This class provides the following features...
	/// 
	/// 1. Multiple Managed IOCP instances per process
	/// 2. Registration of multiple threads per Managed IOCP instance
	/// 3. Dispatching System.Object types to a queue maintained by each 
	///		Managed IOCP instance
	/// 4. Waitable multi-thread safe retrieval of objects from the Managed IOCP
	///		instance queue by all the threads registered for that particular
	///		Managed IOCP instance
	///	5. Ability to restrict number of concurrent active threads processing the
	///		queued objects related to a particular Managed IOCP instance
    ///	6. Policy based replaceable/customizable approach for choosing a 
    ///		registered thread to process next available queued object
    ///	7. Pause the Managed IOCP processing. Internally pauses processing of queued objects
    ///		by registered threads. Also by default disallows enqueuing new objects.
    ///	8. Run the Managed IOCP instance. Internally re-starts the processing of 
    ///		queued objects by registered threads. Also allows enqueuing new objects
    ///	9. Modify the concurrent threads at runtime
    ///	10. Provides easy accesibility to Managed IOCP instance runtime properties like...
    ///		10.1. Number of active concurrent threads
    ///		10.2. Number of objects left in queue
    ///		10.3. Running status
    ///		10.4. Number of allowed concurrent threads
