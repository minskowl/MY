Should the Debug Drawer use the PrimitiveBatch class?

Maybe like this:

  public DebugDrawer(PrimitiveBatch primitiveBatch);
  public DebugDrawer(GraphicsDevice graphicsDevice);

Would allow for shared drawing of debugging primitives.

DrawableComponent Problem still not solved.

Move DrawableComponent to Nuclex.Graphics?
