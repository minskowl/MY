  ///     This class follows the usual game state concept: Instead of using hard-to-maintain
  ///     if-else-trees for deciding whether to render the main menu, game scene or
  ///     credits scroller, each of the game's phases is put in its own game state class. This
  ///     improves modularity and prevents the mixing of code that normally has nothing to
  ///     with each other. The game state manager allows multiple states to be active at
  ///     the same time and manages these active states in a stack, which is useful for
  ///     realizing ingame menus and nested scenes.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     Game states can be either active or inactive and will be notified when this state
  ///     changes by the OnEntered() and OnLeaving() methods. Any game state starts out as
  ///     being inactive. Game states should only load and keep their resources during their
  ///     active period and free them again when they become inactive.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     In addition to being active and inactive, game states also have a pause mode. This
  ///     mode can only be entered by active game states and is used to put the game state
  ///     in the back when another game state serves as a means to halt the
  ///     time in the game state. If multiple game states are active, only the topmost state
  ///     will be in unpaused mode.
