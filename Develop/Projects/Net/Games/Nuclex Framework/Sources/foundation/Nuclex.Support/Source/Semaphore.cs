  ///     This semaphore counts in reverse, which means you can Release() the semaphore
  ///     as often as you'd like a thread calling WaitOne() to be let through. You
  ///     can use it in the traditional sense and have any Thread calling WaitOne()
  ///     make sure to call Release() afterwards, or you can, for example, Release() it
  ///     whenever work becomes available and let threads take work from the Semaphore
  ///     by calling WaitOne() alone.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     Implementation notes (ignore this if you just want to use the Semaphore)
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     We could design a semaphore that uses an auto reset event, where the thread
  ///     that gets to pass immediately sets the event again if the semaphore isn't full
  ///     yet to let another thread pass.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     However, this would mean that when a semaphore receives a large number of
  ///     wait requests, assuming it would allow, for example, 25 users at once, the
  ///     thread scheduler would see only 1 thread become eligible for execution. Then
  ///     that thread would unlock the next and so on. In short, we wait 25 times
  ///     for the thread scheduler to wake up a thread until all users get through.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     So we chose a ManualResetEvent, which will wake up more threads than
  ///     neccessary and possibly cause a period of intense competition for getting
  ///     a lock on the resource, but will make the thread scheduler see all threads
  ///     become eligible for execution.
