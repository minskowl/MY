How to access freedb.org 

It's really simple:

Configure your CDDB1- or freedb-aware software to point to freedb.freedb.org
(Random freedb server) as your CDDB/freedb-server.

All official freedb servers are running cddbp at port 8880 and http at
port 80. The path for http-access is /~cddb/cddb.cgi.
